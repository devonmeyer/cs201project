cs201GlassLine_Team22
=====================

Welcome to my CS201 Project source code. This was a 'glass line factory' project where my team was responsible for creating the Agent logic.

My part was small in code-length, but large in impact. You can see that I handled the "PopupAgent" as well as the "ConveyorAgent" which are the two most complicated agents within the ecosystem.

Additionally, my base Agent interface code was what we used for all of our agents.
